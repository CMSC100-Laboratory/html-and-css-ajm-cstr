## Steps to create a GitHub page:
### - Once you have finalized your HTML and CSS files, push them all to the main branch of the repository.
### - After pushing, go to the repository settings and change its visibility to public.
### - Next, go to the Pages tab of the settings then select the branch you want to deploy from.
### - Lastly, add your custom URL then click save. The website should be published after these steps.

## Key Takeaways:
### - The usage of flex is important as it increases the responsiveness of your website.
### - Classes allow for an easier time when styling sections of your website.
### - HTML and CSS can get confusing really fast if you do not write your code cleanly and in an organized fashion.
